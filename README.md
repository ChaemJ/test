# Lab 9: Using APIs

> This week’s lab will introduce you to how we can use randomized simulations to test the validity of a hypothesis. We focus in on an example from basketball to show how R can offer insight into the question of whether or not players have a “hot hand”. This lab demonstrates how computational models and simulations play an important role when analyzing and interpreting experimental data.
